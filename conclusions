# Data-Visualization
The four conclusions after visualizing the data are:

1. Maximum number of cuisines have a lower cost and the rating decrease as we increase the cost.
2. There is no correlation between latitude and rating. Moreover, mostly ratings are done between 3.5 to 4.8
3. As the average cost increases the votes eventually decrease this might help s to conclude that poeple love ecoonomical things
4. There is a positive correlation between reviews and votes. If the reviews are good the votes are usually more.
